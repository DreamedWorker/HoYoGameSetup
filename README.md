# 米游设置器 (HoYoGameSetup)

HoYoGameSetup is a software based on [WineSkin](https://github.com/Gcenx/WineskinServer). You can quickly install Genshin Impact/Zenless Zone Zero to your Mac through this project.

## Device requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or newer chip)
- macOS 14.0 and newer

## How to install

- Download the installation file (.dmg) from the Release page of this warehouse, and then drag the software to the application folder;
- Open the software in the launchpad;
- If you are prompted with "developer of unknown origin", etc., please release this software in the settings first.

## How to use

- First, select the game and server you want to install;
- Then select the folder you want to store the game data. If the folder you choose already contains the game data, we will directly use the data of this folder; (Note: This step is consistent with the steps you use the 米哈游启动器 to locate the game.)
- (For the new installation) Then, you can let go of your hands, and we will follow the steps on the screen to prepare the game for you; (Note: The yellow task bar indicates that it has not been carried out or is in progress, the green one indicates that it has been completed, and the red one means that it has failed.)
- (For the use of existing data) We will record the directory you selected and write it to the startup parameters so that you can open it directly;
- Finally, start your two-dimensional journey!

## Acknowledgement

The birth of this software cannot be separated from [YuanShen_launcher_mac_porting](https://github.com/Coulin9/YuanShen_launcher_mac_porting)'s supports and other open-source software. The installation process of this software is completely based on the "YuanShen_launcher_mac_porting" project, which is actually a graphical version of the project.

- Compared with the original project, this software no longer requires you to clone the repository, download homebrew and kotlin, which is more friendly to beginners.

At the same time, thank you to Jetbrains and the open source community for their efforts on [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/)!
